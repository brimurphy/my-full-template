# My Very First Web Page

###### Brian Murphy

## Getting Started:

This is the first project I'm working on through my Code Institute
*Fullstack Web Developer* course.

## What I have Learned:

The project is in the *User Centric Frontend Development* module.
Mark Rudge is the lecturer. 

I have three html files all linked to each other. On each page there is
a six hyperlinks to a technology I will be using in different sections 
of the course.

I've used CSS to style the links.

The main purpose of this project has been to introduce the student to gitpod
and how to push repositories to github to save their work.
I hadn't used github or gitpod before and that has been the first 
technology I've used on the course that I hadn'technology used before.

## Technologies Used:

html

CSS

gitpod

github
